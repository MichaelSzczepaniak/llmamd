    "# Classification of Kaggle Disaster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explore whether a HuggingFace model (HFM) can enhance the performance of non-transformer-based text classification models by augmenting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this project comes from the kaggle *Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets* competition at:  \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data\n",
    "\n",
    "This data consists of two files: *train.csv* (x labled tweets) and *test.csv* (y unlabled tweets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the *test.csv* labels are not available, the *train.csv* file was split into the following two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ train_model.csv - data used to train model, x labeled tweets\n",
    "+ train_test.csv - not used to train model, used as *pseudo-test* data, y labeled tweets \n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Transformer Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of models are created and compared:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression - This serves as the baseline\n",
    "2. Single-Hidden layer neural network with 100 nodes in the hidden layer\n",
    "\n",
    "## HuggingFace Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The *TBD* Hugging Face transformer model was used to provide both uninformed and informed assistance through augmenting the data used to train the non-transformer-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of encodings are used to vectorize the inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-hot encoding\n",

    "The following issues observered in the data are listed below.  They are numbered to indicate the order in which they were processed.  For example, spillover lines were fixed first, then URLs, etc.  This order is important because removing things like punctuation too early would make things like identifying user names or hashtags in a tweet impossible or make URLs invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Spillover lines\n",
    "\n",
    "The first issue we see with this data is that while most of the samples are on there own line. Here are few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`61,ablaze,,\"on the outside you're ablaze and alive`  \n",
    ">`but you're dead inside\",0`  \n",
    ">`74,ablaze,India,\"Man wife get six years jail for setting ablaze niece`  \n",
    ">`http://t.co/eV1ahOUCZA\",1`  \n",
    ">`86,ablaze,Inang Pamantasan,\"Progressive greetings!`  \n",
    ">  \n",
    ">`In about a month students would have set their pens ablaze in The Torch Publications'... http://t.co/9FxPiXQuJt\",0`  \n",
    ">`117,accident,,\"mom: 'we didn't get home as fast as we wished'`  \n",
    ">`me: 'why is that?'`  \n",
    ">`mom: 'there was an accident and some truck spilt mayonnaise all over ??????\",0`\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom function `fix_spillover_lines` was written to fix these lines. Its code is available in the projtools module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tweet contain one or more URLs.  I assume that the content of a ULR does not contain any useful.  However, the count of URLs occuring in a tweet may be a useful feature and are counted before removing them.  About 90% of the URLs in the training data are of the form `http://t.co/<10 digit hash>`. For example: `http://t.co/9FxPiXQuJt`.  In about 10% of cases, these URLs start with `https:\\\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Count URLs in each tweet\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom function `make_url_counts` is used to create a `url_count` feature/column.  This is called before removing the URLs as described in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Remove URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "The `replace_urls` function replaces each URL by the string \"web link\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Punctuation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Process Twitter-specifc characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the `@` and `#` characters have special meaning in tweets, they need to be processed before removing other punctuation.  When a `@<username>` is seen in a tweet, it is a reference to a user names `username`.  When a `#<hashname>` is seen in a tweet, it specifies a hashtag which is a reference to all tweet tweets that use the `hashname` hashtag.  In processing these characters, `@<username>` is converted to `at username` and `#<hashname>` is converted to `hashtag hashname`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Remove remaining punctuation\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom function `replace_with_space` is run to remove any remaining punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Remove digits\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `replace_with_space` is run to remove any remaining digits.\n",
