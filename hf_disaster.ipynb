    "# Classification of Kaggle Disaster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explore whether a HuggingFace model (HFM) can enhance the performance of non-transformer-based text classification models by augmenting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this project comes from the kaggle *Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets* competition at:  \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data\n",
    "\n",
    "This data consists of two files: *train.csv* (x labled tweets) and *test.csv* (y unlabled tweets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the *test.csv* labels are not available, the *train.csv* file was split into the following two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ train_model.csv - data used to train model, x labeled tweets\n",
    "+ train_test.csv - not used to train model, used as *pseudo-test* data, y labeled tweets \n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Transformer Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of models are created and compared:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression - This serves as the baseline\n",
    "2. Single-Hidden layer neural network with 100 nodes in the hidden layer\n",
    "\n",
    "## HuggingFace Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The *TBD* Hugging Face transformer model was used to provide both uninformed and informed assistance through augmenting the data used to train the non-transformer-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of encodings are used to vectorize the inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-hot encoding\n",
    "2. Twitter GloVe embedding: https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.twitter.27B.zip\n"
