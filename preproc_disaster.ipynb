    "# LLM Training Data Augmentation - Classification of Kaggle Disaster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explore whether a HuggingFace model (HFM) can enhance the performance of non-transformer-based text classification models by augmenting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this project comes from the kaggle *Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets* competition at:  \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data\n",
    "\n",
    "This data consists of two files:\n",
    "+ *train.csv* - 7613 labled tweets\n",
    "+ *test.csv* - 3236 unlabled tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the *test.csv* labels are not available, the *train.csv* file was split into the following two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ train_model.csv - data used to train model, 6090 labeled tweets\n",
    "+ train_test.csv - held out and not used to train model, used as *pseudo-test* data, 1523 labeled tweets (~20% of the original training sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Transformer Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of models are created and compared:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression - This serves as the baseline\n",
    "2. Single-Hidden layer neural network with 1000 nodes in the hidden layer\n",
    "\n",
    "## HuggingFace Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The *TBD* Hugging Face transformer model was used to provide both uninformed and informed assistance through augmenting the data used to train the non-transformer-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of encodings are used to vectorize the inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-hot encoding\n",
    "2. Twitter GloVe embedding: https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.twitter.27B.zip\n"

    "## Manual inspection of train.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "The following issues observered in the data are listed below.  They are numbered to indicate the order in which they were processed.  For example, spillover lines were fixed first, then URLs, etc.  This order is important because removing things like punctuation too early would make things like identifying user names or hashtags in a tweet impossible or make URLs invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Spillover lines\n",
    "\n",
    "The first issue we see with this data is that while most of the samples are on there own line. Here are few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`61,ablaze,,\"on the outside you're ablaze and alive`  \n",
    ">`but you're dead inside\",0`  \n",
    ">`74,ablaze,India,\"Man wife get six years jail for setting ablaze niece`  \n",
    ">`http://t.co/eV1ahOUCZA\",1`  \n",
    ">`86,ablaze,Inang Pamantasan,\"Progressive greetings!`  \n",
    ">  \n",
    ">`In about a month students would have set their pens ablaze in The Torch Publications'... http://t.co/9FxPiXQuJt\",0`  \n",
    ">`117,accident,,\"mom: 'we didn't get home as fast as we wished'`  \n",
    ">`me: 'why is that?'`  \n",
    ">`mom: 'there was an accident and some truck spilt mayonnaise all over ??????\",0`\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom function `fix_spillover_lines` was written to fix these lines. Its code is available in the projtools module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Normalizing URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tweet contain one or more URLs.  I assume that the content of a ULR does not contain any useful, but since a `<url>` token exists in the twitter gloVe embeddings, URLS will be replaced by this token.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the actual URL may not contain much useful information, the count of URLs occuring in a tweet may be a useful feature and are counted before they are normalized.  About 90% of the URLs in the training data are of the form `http://t.co/<10 digit hash>`. For example: `http://t.co/9FxPiXQuJt`.  In about 10% of cases, these URLs start with `https:\\\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Counting URLs in each tweet\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom function `make_url_counts` is used to create a `url_count` feature/column.  This needs to be called before calling `replace_urls`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Normalizing URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "The `replace_urls` function replaces each URL by the string \"<url>\" for the reasons stated above.  The needs to be called after `replace_urls` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 Process Twitter-specifc characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the `@` and `#` characters have special meaning in tweets, they need to be processed before removing other punctuation.  When a `@<username>` is seen in a tweet, it is a reference to a user whose name is `username`.  When a `#<hashname>` is seen in a tweet, it specifies a hashtag which is a reference to all tweet tweets that use the `hashname` hashtag.  In processing these characters, `@<username>` is converted to `<user> username` and `#<hashname>` is converted to `<hashtag> hashname`.  These replacement tokens were selected because they also have mappings in the embeddings file described in the **Normalizing URLs** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Tokenize text and clean up non-words\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Contractions\n",
    "\n",
    "Contraction fragments are included as vectorized tokens in the twitter gloVe embeddings which means that we don't need to expand these manually.  The spaCy tokenizer will separate the first word from the contraction fragments: e.g \"you're\" will be tokenized into `[\"you\", \"'re\"]`.  Because the embeddings file has a listing for the contraction fragment token `'re` (as well as other contraction fragments such as 'm, 's, 'll, etc.), we don't need to convert these to their actual word forms (e.g. \"am\", \"is\", \"will\", etc.) before vectorizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Remove remaining punctuation\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom function `replace_with_space` is run to remove any remaining punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3 Remove digits\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `replace_numbers` is run to replace sets of consecutive digits digits with the token `<number>`.  As with the other token replacements, this one also was chosen because it has a mappling in the embeddings file.\n",
    "\n"
